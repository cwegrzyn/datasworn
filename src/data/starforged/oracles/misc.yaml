            This oracle will introduce narrative turns, troubles, and revelations. It can be used as an alternative to the [Pay the Price](starforged/moves/fate/pay_the_price) table when you encounter a negative outcome at a crucial moment. In particular, you might use this table after rolling matched 10s on the challenge dice.
