        The **session moves** fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

        Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

            **When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

              * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](starforged/moves/session/set_a_flag).
              * Review or recap what happened last session.
              * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

            In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

              * **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
              * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
              * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.

              * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

        In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.

            **When your expedition comes to an end**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

            On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination or complete your survey. Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also mark the reward.

            On a **weak hit**, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower, and envision what you encounter.

            On a **miss**, your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and choose one.

              * Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and [Pay the Price](starforged/moves/fate/pay_the_price).
              * Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition's rank by one (if not already epic).

        The Forge is a perilous galaxy. Factions fight for control. Pirates hunt the spaceways. Raiders prey on vulnerable settlements. Dangerous creatures and chaotic terrors stalk the unwary. Dreaded foes and powerful forces will oppose your sworn quests. Eventually, you'll be forced to fight.

        When you face one or more foes in high-stakes, action-oriented conflict, use the **combat moves**. These moves encompass on-foot action and vehicle sorties—or both as part of the same challenge.

                  * See it through: Choose one of the former character's unfinished quests, and [Swear an Iron Vow](starforged/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) (with an automatic strong hit) to see it done. You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.
                  * Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way. When you [Make a Connection](starforged/moves/connection/make_a_connection) with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.
                  * Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

                Alternatively, you may choose a miss option:

                  * Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.
                  * Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.
                  * Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.

      description: |-
        A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.

        Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate before a council, or competing in a hoverbike race.
