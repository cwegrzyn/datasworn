        The Sundered, an Ironlands warband, was formed of those who suffered the traumas of battle—but whose fighting spirit remained. Khinara the Half-Handed, a shrewd leader outcast from her former band, brought these misfits together to forge a new path. Their final and most renowned battle was to stand against an overwhelming force of varou at the Siege of Winterhill. Nearly all the Sundered fell in that long day of fighting, but not before saving many Ironlanders from the varou horde.

        Khinara and her handful of remaining comrades left the battleground that day and have not been seen since. A simple cairn marked the sacrifice and courage of the Sundered, from which only this small stone remains.

        This simple leather bracer was worn generations ago by the first person killed by your kin-blade. At that time, it was a simple weapon wielded by your ancestor. With their dying breath, the blade’s victim cursed your ancestor to an afterlife of iron servitude, binding them forever to the weapon.

        The bracer is weathered and marred by faded blood stains. When worn on your blade-arm, you feel a stronger connection to your ancestor within the iron. But there is another presence here, and you sense its long-simmering thirst for revenge.

        Ages ago, this waterskin, filled with wine, was passed among the fighters of a warband on the night before a fateful battle. They drunk heartily, sang hopeful tunes, and swore promises to one another. None would be left behind, they vowed. All would fall or stand together.

        By the dawn, all lie dead. But their loyalty and companionship infused this waterskin with the purity of those vows. Anything it contains—water, wine, or mead—is made sweeter and more refreshing. When you bear the skin, your own nature might change subtly, and others may view you more favorably.

When pressed to the forehead of an elven mask, the shard sets itself into a hollow and glimmers with ancient power. Then, the mask makes a dramatic change to its features, such as sprouting wooden horns or antlers. A mask with the Progenitor Shard may even display new awareness and intelligence, reacting to others through subtle changes of its once-inert expression.

That warrior failed in his oath to protect his queen when she was assassinated by a usurper. In honor of his fallen liege, he undertook a new years-long quest that toppled kingdoms and remade the world. At the end of it, he shattered his sword and made no more vows. What’s left of the blade is said to hold an essence of the resolve that set the warrior on his path of retribution.

        This mark is branded or tattooed onto the flesh of outcasts. It is the sigil of an Old World leader, betrayed by their own kin, who was stripped of their name and banished to the wilderness. They eventually returned to undo the schemes of those who cast them out. But even after they were welcomed back into their community, they chose to disappear again into the wilds—committed to their new life in exile.

        Now the sigil, inscribed or branded as part of lengthy ceremony, marks the forsaken or misunderstood among the Ironlanders and gives them the strength to carry on. Only a few still hold the knowledge of the ritual which sets this mark upon your flesh.

After an unceremonious reintroduction to the world, the Slayer’s Medallion was retrieved and handed from one ill-fated hunter to the next.

        The silver, now gouged by teeth and claw and pitted by digestive juices, is said to hold the hard lessons of every failed bowshot, every clumsy spear thrust, every weakened shield-arm. Perhaps these mistakes will not be your own.

        Long ago, in the southlands of the Old World, a rich merchant believed he was haunted by the spirit of his beloved dead wife. But the signs of her presence were subtle. The smell of her perfume. An occasional chill. A barely-heard whisper. He longed to see her again, so he gathered the greatest artisans and mystics of the land to create a solution. Years later, they delivered a grand, gold-rimmed mirror that—they said—would reveal worlds and beings beyond the veil. The hopeful merchant had the mirror placed in his chambers and sent his staff away. A day later, a servant returned to find the merchant vanished and the mirror shattered.

        This piece of broken glass, the edges smoothed by time, the surface darkened and tarnished, is all that remains of that ancient mirror. Carrying it with you strengthens the thread between you and those that dwell in the realms between life and death.

        This stitched mantle is a patchwork of different pelts—some recognizable, some less so. When you wear the mantle, the ferocity and resilience of these animals and beasts is with you. Your foes may even look upon you and catch the briefest glimpses of these creatures upon your own form, like phantasms seen in the afterglow of a lightning strike.

        The greatsword of a fallen warrior was melted down and reforged into this exquisite pair of blades. Each piece in the Iron Dyad is a formidable weapon in its own right, light and well balanced, with a keen edge. Throughout history, these masterworks have been kept apart. Now, reunited in your hands, they whirl in a perfect, synchronous dance, dealing death with grim efficiency.

        The wooden hilt of this delicate knife is carved in the form of a diving hawk.

When the arrow flies true, you may even hear it accompanied by the cry of a hawk.

        Some in the Ironlands speak of a figure known as the Rover, who wandered from settlement to settlement and was said to bring divine fortune. The figure dressed simply, came and went without fanfare or frivolity, and carried a gnarled staff of yew adorned with trinkets and etched with symbols of the firstborn. This staff, worn to a polished shine from decades of use, now fits in your own hand as if designed for it.

The haft of this weapon is simple and mundane, unadorned. The spear’s point is formed with a layer of cold iron around a core of strange black metal. Some say the dark center is fashioned from the fossilized heart of mother dragon, the once-queen of dragonkind.

Its mightiest blows are sometimes accompanied by a distant peal of thunder.

        This clay decanter once belonged to an ancient mystic who dabbled in the secrets of life and death. Wracked with disease, facing his own mortality, he vowed he would endure. He inscribed the decanter with runes of power, and breathed his dying words into it. In that moment, clinging to the mortal world like a drowning man struggling to stay above the surface, his fear and anger infused the decanter with an unending breath.

For example, you might throw it in its usual alabaster form, and see it land as pitted black pumice. Divining the meaning of this trickery is not always easy—the riddlestone is a notoriously fickle tool.

        Before setting off on a perilous voyage, a sailor gifted his husband a piece of string—cut from the thread he used to tie back his hair. “Even when it seems we are apart,” he told him, “we are connected. This will guide me back home. Back to you.”

        But his ship did not return. Weeks passed. Then months. All hope seemed lost. One night, as the mourning husband held the string tight in a closed fist, there came a knock at the door. It was the sailor, with no memory of what brought him there.

        Centuries later, these twin strings—passed into legend and now returned—are held in a simple wooden box. When you carry it, you are reminded of the importance of a place and the people there, and it helps set you on the path home.
