      Some assets will bring a rarity into play more often than others, so the experience point cost for a rarity will vary by the linked asset. These costs are shown in the tables on page 175.

      If you are playing solo, and arenâ€™t concerned with the relative balance of rarity abilities, you can ignore these variable costs. If so, spend 3 experience points to purchase a rarity.`
