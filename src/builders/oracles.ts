// Ajv has several options that allow to modify data during validation:

//     removeAdditional - to remove properties not defined in the schema object.
//     useDefaults - to assign defaults from the schema to the validated data properties.
//     coerceTypes - to change data type, when possible, to match the type(s) in the schema.
