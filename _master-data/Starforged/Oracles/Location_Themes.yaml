      Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within an unusual, aberrant, or important location.

      Each theme on the following pages includes a set of oracles.

        * **Feature:** Use this table to reveal a new aspect of the location.
        * **Peril:** Use this table to help envision a complication or hazard.
        * **Opportunity:** Use this table to help envision a beneficial encounter or event, such as when rolling a strong hit with a match in a location.

      You can answer questions about a place using only the tables provided for a theme, such as when delving into an **Infested** cave. Or pair a theme with other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might explore a **Haunted Grave World**, a **Ruined Derelict**, a **Sacred Precursor Vault**, or an **Inhabited Settlement**.

      When mixing-and-matching a theme with another set of tables, use the techniques described for an **oracle array** (page 384) to determine which oracle you reference for that question or phase of your exploration.
