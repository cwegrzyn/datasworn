          Use the Space Sightings oracle to introduce a location or encounter on a spaceborne expedition. For example, roll on this table when you [Ask the Oracle](starforged/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) to envision the primary feature of a waypoint as you [Undertake an Expedition](starforged/moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition). Check your result by referencing the column for your current location: Terminus, Outlands, or Expanse.
