      The Sundered, an Ironlands warband, was formed of those who suffered the traumas of battle—but whose fighting spirit remained. Khinara the Half-Handed, a shrewd leader outcast from her former band, brought these misfits together to forge a new path. Their final and most renowned battle was to stand against an overwhelming force of varou at the Siege of Winterhill. Nearly all the Sundered fell in that long day of fighting, but not before saving many Ironlanders from the varou horde.

      Khinara and her handful of remaining comrades left the battleground that day and have not been seen since. A simple cairn marked the sacrifice and courage of the Sundered, from which only this small stone remains.

      This simple leather bracer was worn generations ago by the first person killed by your kin-blade. At that time, it was a simple weapon wielded by your ancestor. With their dying breath, the blade’s victim cursed your ancestor to an afterlife of iron servitude, binding them forever to the weapon.

      The bracer is weathered and marred by faded blood stains. When worn on your blade-arm, you feel a stronger connection to your ancestor within the iron. But there is another presence here, and you sense its long-simmering thirst for revenge.

      Ages ago, this waterskin, filled with wine, was passed among the fighters of a warband on the night before a fateful battle. They drunk heartily, sang hopeful tunes, and swore promises to one another. None would be left behind, they vowed. All would fall or stand together.

      By the dawn, all lie dead. But their loyalty and companionship infused this waterskin with the purity of those vows. Anything it contains—water, wine, or mead—is made sweeter and more refreshing. When you bear the skin, your own nature might change subtly, and others may view you more favorably.

In honor of his fallen liege, he undertook a new years-long quest that toppled kingdoms and remade the world. At the end of it, he shattered his sword and made no more vows.

But even after they were welcomed back into their community, they chose to disappear again into the wilds—committed to their new life in exile.

      Now the sigil, inscribed or branded as part of lengthy ceremony, marks the forsaken or misunderstood among the Ironlanders and gives them the strength to carry on. Only a few still hold the knowledge of the ritual which sets this mark upon your flesh.

      Long ago, in the southlands of the Old World, a rich merchant believed he was haunted by the spirit of his beloved dead wife. But the signs of her presence were subtle. The smell of her perfume. An occasional chill. A barely-heard whisper. He longed to see her again, so he gathered the greatest artisans and mystics of the land to create a solution. Years later, they delivered a grand, gold-rimmed mirror that—they said—would reveal worlds and beings beyond the veil. The hopeful merchant had the mirror placed in his chambers and sent his staff away. A day later, a servant returned to find the merchant vanished and the mirror shattered.

      This piece of broken glass, the edges smoothed by time, the surface darkened and tarnished, is all that remains of that ancient mirror. Carrying it with you strengthens the thread between you and those that dwell in the realms between life and death.

      The greatsword of a fallen warrior was melted down and reforged into this exquisite pair of blades. Each piece in the Iron Dyad is a formidable weapon in its own right, light and well balanced, with a keen edge. Throughout history, these masterworks have been kept apart. Now, reunited in your hands, they whirl in a perfect, synchronous dance, dealing death with grim efficiency.

      The wooden hilt of this delicate knife is carved in the form of a diving hawk. When used to fashion arrow shafts or trim fletchings, the blade imparts the speed and deadliness of that majestic creature to the arrow itself. When the arrow flies true, you may even hear it accompanied by the cry of a hawk.

      This chain shirt is fashioned from rings of black iron, a starforged metal notoriously difficult to work in such delicate forms. It is as strong and resistant as the sturdiest shield. The glimmering black chain is beautiful to behold—like a clear night sky strung with iridescent stars.

      When you wear the armor, you are connected to the eternal void beyond our own world. At night, the stars call to you with an alluring song.

      Some in the Ironlands speak of a figure known as the Rover, who wandered from settlement to settlement and was said to bring divine fortune. The figure dressed simply, came and went without fanfare or frivolity, and carried a gnarled staff of yew adorned with trinkets and etched with symbols of the firstborn. This staff, worn to a polished shine from decades of use, now fits in your own hand as if designed for it.

      The name of the warrior who wielded Dragon’s Bite, who felled dragons of old, is lost to time. But the spear, its tip heated in the flames of dragons and quenched in their blood, is legend. The haft of this weapon is simple and mundane, unadorned. The spear’s point is formed with a layer of cold iron around a core of strange black metal. Some say the dark center is fashioned from the fossilized heart of mother dragon, the once-queen of dragonkind.

      Before the passing of the giants in the Old World, one of their clan terrorized a highland village. For months the people suffered the torment of the giant, until a brave villager felled him with this sling.

Said to have been crafted by the giant smiths of old, the Hammer of Reckoning was a gift bestowed upon an ancient people of the Ironlands. Forged during a great storm, and imbued with the essence of that violent tempest, it is a superbly balanced and destructive weapon. Its mightiest blows are sometimes accompanied by a distant peal of thunder.

      This clay decanter once belonged to an ancient mystic who dabbled in the secrets of life and death. Wracked with disease, facing his own mortality, he vowed he would endure. He inscribed the decanter with runes of power, and breathed his dying words into it. In that moment, clinging to the mortal world like a drowning man struggling to stay above the surface, his fear and anger infused the decanter with an unending breath.

      When you release the stopper to aid the creation of your simulacrum, those last words sometimes escape as whispered curses.

      Carved from a snow-white chunk of alabaster, this runestone of uncertain origin reveals a new inscription each time it is thrown.

      The stone makes some secrets obvious, and teases others through implication. For a particularly dire or surprising reading, it may even show a different surface or texture. For example, you might throw it in its usual alabaster form, and see it land as pitted black pumice. Divining the meaning of this trickery is not always easy—the riddlestone is a notoriously fickle tool.

      Before setting off on a perilous voyage, a sailor gifted his husband a piece of string—cut from the thread he used to tie back his hair. “Even when it seems we are apart,” he told him, “we are connected. This will guide me back home. Back to you.”

      But his ship did not return. Weeks passed. Then months. All hope seemed lost. One night, as the mourning husband held the string tight in a closed fist, there came a knock at the door. It was the sailor, with no memory of what brought him there.

      Centuries later, these twin strings—passed into legend and now returned—are held in a simple wooden box. When you carry it, you are reminded of the importance of a place and the people there, and it helps set you on the path home.
