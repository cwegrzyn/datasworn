          When **you achieve what you believe to be the fulfillment of your vow**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

          On a **strong hit**, your quest is complete. Mark experience (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5).

          On a **weak hit**, there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. Envision what you discover ([Ask the Oracle](Ironsworn/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) if unsure). Then, mark experience (troublesome=0; dangerous=1; formidable=2; extreme=3; epic=4). You may [Swear an Iron Vow](Ironsworn/Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to set things right. If you do, add +1.

          On a **miss**, your quest is undone. Envision what happens ([Ask the Oracle](Ironsworn/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) if unsure), and choose one.

            * You recommit: Clear all but one filled progress, and raise the quest’s rank by one (if not already epic).
            * You give up: [Forsake Your Vow](Ironsworn/Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow).

    Description: |-
      In solo and co-op play, the fate moves mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places and events external to your character, the fate moves help you discover an answer.

      In guided mode, your GM represents the whims of fate. They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.

      There are three key aspects of using the fate moves:
        * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.
        * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.
        * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.

          When **you suffer the outcome of a move**, choose one.

            * Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.
            * Envision two negative outcomes. Rate one as ‘likely’, and [Ask the Oracle](Ironsworn/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) using the yes/no table. On a ‘yes’, make that outcome happen. Otherwise, make it the other.
            * Roll on the following table. If you have difficulty interpreting the result to fit the current situation, roll again.

          Roll  | Result
          ------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          1-2   | Roll again and apply that result but make it worse. If you roll this result yet again, think of something dreadful that changes the course of your quest ([Ask the Oracle](Ironsworn/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) if unsure) and make it happen.
          3-5   | A person or community you trusted loses faith in you, or acts against you.
          6-9   | A person or community you care about is exposed to danger.
          10-16 | You are separated from something or someone.
          17-23 | Your action has an unintended effect.
          24-32 | Something of value is lost or destroyed.
          33-41 | The current situation worsens.
          42-50 | A new danger or foe is revealed.
          51-59 | It causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.
          60-68 | It is harmful.
          69-76 | It is stressful.
          77-85 | A surprising development complicates your quest.
          86-90 | It wastes resources.
          91-94 | It forces you to act against your best intentions.
          95-98 | A friend, companion, or ally is put in harm’s way (or you are, if alone).
          99-00 | Roll twice more on this table. Both results occur. If they are the same result, make it worse.
