    Description: |-
      History is often chronicled through objects of power. Wars and accords, struggles and triumphs, love and hate, sacrifice and death—these legacies can imbue objects with cultural importance and supernatural gifts.

      In **Ironsworn**, these items are called *rarities*. They may be handed down through generations, lost or hidden away in the depths of perilous sites, coveted by powerful forces, or forgotten and discarded. When you obtain a rarity through the course of your story, you gain a subtle but lasting impact on your character and their abilities.

          When **you make a move aided by an augmented asset**, roll your rarity die in place of your action die.

          On **any result** with 6 showing on the rarity die, the power of the rarity manifests in a dramatic and obvious way. You score an automatic **strong hit** and take +1 momentum.

          On a **hit** with 5 showing on the rarity die, the power of the rarity manifests in a subtle way. Take +1 momentum.

          On a **miss** with 1 showing on the rarity die, the rarity’s power fails or works against you.
