    Title:
      Canonical: Combat Event
    Summary: Determine the actions of a character, creature, or force during a fight.
    Description: |-
      Use the Combat Event oracles to answer questions about the actions of a foe or enemy force. You can use these oracles instead of—or in addition to—the [Combat Action](ironsworn/oracles/turning_point/combat_action) oracle.

      Roll once each on the [Method](ironsworn/oracles/combat_event/method) oracle and the [Target](ironsworn/oracles/combat_event/target) oracle. Then, interpret the response as appropriate to the current situation and the nature of your foe.

      For example, you are fighting a rhaskar, a bear-like beast. It has initiative, and you want to know what it does next. You [Ask the Oracle](Ask the Oracle), rolling [Method](ironsworn/oracles/combat_event/method) and [Target](ironsworn/oracles/combat_event/target). The oracle responds, “Await Weakness.” You envision the rhaskar circling you, its keen eyes narrowing as it looks for an opening in your defenses. You must [Face Danger](Face Danger) to avoid being outmaneuvered.
