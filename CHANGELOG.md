## Changes from Dataforged Legacy

### Breaking changes

#### General

* object properties are now `snake_case` (lower cased separated by underscores) rather than inconsistently applied title case with spaces
  * **important:** this is very serious breaking change. in fact it will break pretty much **everything**!
  * **also note:** ID maps (e.g. hash objects) and/or functions will be provided to make the conversion easier
  * 1.5.0 will remain available, of course, so you can make the migration in your own time (or never, if you decide it's not worth it)
  * **but why do this at all?**
    * prose labels were nice for readability, but at this point it's more useful if it fits more neatly with one of the *de facto* standards for JSON schema (the other option being `camelCase`). in other words - many languages expect JSON data in this shape anyways, so they're generally equipped to handle `snake_case` keys (or someone has written a handy library to do so)
    * `snake_case` also has the advantage of lining up with the changes to IDs, below
    * coinciding with other breaking changes means folks only have to make the migration once. so while it'll be something of a chore now, i reckon this is the **least** crappy time to do it
* significant changes to composition of `$id`s
  * IDs are now *lower case* with underscores, to make them friendly to as many environments as possible
  * asset abilities follow he same principle as e.g. oracle tables, and don't bother to note their most important child element's prop name (abilities for assets, table rows for oracle tables)
    * example: `starforged/assets/companion/sidekick/abilities/1` has become `starforged/assets/companion/sidekick/1`
* a new constant, `LEGACY_ID_MAP`, is now exported for use with Dataforged. it's a plain object, where the keys are the current ID and the values are the corresponding legacy ID.
  * currently, this is a quick-and-dirty implementation, but my plan is to include most or all IDs at release to make conversion as painless as possible
* major restructuring of internal and external interface/class names and their organization
  * public interfaces (the bulk of dataforged's API) are no longer prefixed with "I". example: `IEncounter` is now `Encounter`
  * internal builder classes are now suffixed with "Builder"
  * internal interfaces for generating YAML schemas are now prefixed with `Yaml`
* many arrays of named objects (including oracles, moves, assets, etc) are now instead represented with keyed objects
* `Name` key removed (as it was trying to do too many jobs). in its place is `title`, an object which provides the proeprties `canonical`, `standard`, and `short` version of the item's title. items which can't rightly be said to have a title of their own, like asset inputs, receive `label` (a string) instead.

#### Assets and Moves

* "Health" on companion assets is now labelled "companion health"
* "Integrity" on vehicle cards is now labelled "vehicle integrity"
* internal references to stats (as opposed to localizable user-facing labels) and the like are now `snake_case` rather than title case. all of these are reflected in the relevant enums, so if you're already using those, the changeover should be relatively painless
  * examples:
    * `Shadow` is now `shadow` (enum: `Stat`)
    * `Health` is now `health` (enum: `PlayerConditionMeter`)
    * `Journey Progress` is now `journey_progress`
* names are now provided for Ironsworn ritual moves (so their IDs may have changed)
* the URLs provided by `image` and `icons` are now relative to the root directory rather than pretending that the relative url is somehow useful ;) they're also lower cased, both to match with the new `$id`s and to be a little more predictable for use on the web
    * old: `../../img/vector/Oracles/Creature/Environment/Space.svg`
    * new: `icon/oracles/creature/environment/space.svg`

#### Oracles

* complete overhaul of oracle table display data -- see `OracleSet.display.columns` and `OracleTable.display.columns`
* roll templates (type `RowTemplate`) now demarcate strings to be replaced with `{{oracle_id}}` rather than `${{Oracle_Id}}`. Admittedly, this is a bit arbitrary, and is mainly so that internal JSON template replacement when Dataforged builds from YAML uses a replacement demarcation distinct from roll templates. example:
  * old: `"${{Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Affiliation}} of the ${{Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Legacy}} ${{Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Identity}}"`
  * new: `"{{starforged/oracles/factions/affiliation}} of the {{starforged/oracles/factions/legacy}} {{starforged/oracles/factions/identity}}"`
* restructure of `IOracle` + `IOracleCategory` into `OracleTable` and `OracleSet`
  * "leaf" nodes (ones with a `table` property) key are now **always** `OracleTable`
  * "branch" nodes (ones that previously had `Oracles` or `Categories`) are now `OracleSet`
    * `OracleSet.sets` is a keyed object of any `OracleSet` children belonging to that set.
    * `OracleSet.tables` is a keyed object of any `OracleTable` children belonging to that oracle set.
  * to make this new scheme consistent, some oracle objects have been re-organized, and may have new IDs
* for `OracleSet` and `OracleTable`, `Category` and `Member of` are now replaced by a single array called `ancestors`, which contains the string IDs of every `OracleSet` from which the item descends

### Other API changes
* `Source` now includes a `license` property, containing a URL pointing to the relevant license.
* everything that has a localizable string descendent (direct or otherwise) now has an `$id`, putting us one step closer to extracting complete localization data
* `OracleBase` (and its descendants, `OracleSet` and `OracleTable`) may now have `summary` in addition to `description`, consistent with some other objects in dataforgeds. `summary` is for providing a brief summary of the article (a couple sentences tops), while `description` includes more detailed information (often multiple paragraphs).

### Fixes
* Fixed incorrect data in many `MoveOutcomes` (and asset `AlterMoveOutcomes`) due to a janky build script

### New content
#### Starforged
* Sundered Isles preview of the Kraken asset
#### Ironsworn preview content
* Ironlands region entries (with a **lot** of link annotation)
* Ironlands encounter entries (ditto)
* Ironlands setting truths
* Delve site themes and domains
