They have short hind limbs and elongated forelimbs which extend along their wings. In flight, they are a terrifying but awe-inspiring creature. On the ground, they lumber heavily on all four limbs, their wings folded back, jaws agape, gaze fixed on their prey.\n\nThey are the grim cruelty of the Ironlands given form. They are death.",

To protect itself from potential predators, a gnarl will stand among a copse of trees. It will plant its feet, straighten its back, stretch its neck, and stay perfectly still, blending in with its surroundings.\n\nThe low, resonant call of a gnarl can carry for miles.

The stones hunger for new knowledge, and our memories are fodder for their insatiable appetites. What they take is sometimes gone forever.\n\nSome [Ironlanders](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) enter a circle willingly. Perhaps they hope to abandon a painful memory to the stones, discarding that piece of themselves like slag hammered from wrought iron. Then, there are those who wish to forsake the world and live with their memories. For them, an unreal life within the circle is better than the cruel reality outside of it.\n\nThose in need of information may choose to risk a negotiation within a circle. Knowledge for knowledge is the customary trade, but the stones are cunning and may demand a more horrible price.",

Relief from the dangers of the Ironlands or a quick journey to a distant destination is a tempting invitation, but not without its own price.\n\nThe path the glimmer reveals is not wholly of our world. It can descend into the past, or climb into the future. It can wend its way across other lands and through strange realities. These trails are navigated not just by the glimmer, but by ancient, baneful things beyond comprehension.\n\nIf you accept a glimmer’s guidance, steel yourself for the journey. Envision the places and people that give you hope, and you may find yourself among them. But do not be distracted. The temptations and terrors along the way can lead all but the most resolute astray.

Once enveloped, the victim is a captive audience for the gloom’s apparitions, forced to face their innermost doubts and fears. The gloom picks at their sanity like a scavenger cleaning meat from bones. After a time, there is nothing left but an empty shell.\n\nIf trapped within a gloom, let your conviction and courage be your light. Against hopelessness, find hope.
