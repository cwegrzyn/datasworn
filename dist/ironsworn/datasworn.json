If they don’t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.\n\nCompanions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](Ironsworn/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Endure_Harm) move to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.",

A river primordial is a mass of rock, gravel, and flowing water. A forest primordial is comprised of wood, earth, rocks, and plants. A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice. A fire primordial, depending on its mood, might take form as embers, ash and smoke—or as a raging pyre.\n\nThey range in size from the height of an [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) to half-again as tall as a giant. Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the [Wilds](Ironsworn/Encounters/Deep_Wilds), or high in the ranges of the [Veiled Mountains](Ironsworn/Regions/Veiled_Mountains), who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?\n\nPrimordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.\n\nHow do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A [mystic](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders/Mystic) might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them.

When you face the outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places and events external to your character, the fate moves help you discover an answer.\n\nIn guided mode, your GM represents the whims of fate. They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.\n\nThere are three key aspects of using the fate moves:\n  * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.\n  * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.\n  * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.",

Combined, the Action and Theme tables provide creative prompts suitable for most situations and questions. In fact, with some creative interpretations, it’s entirely possible to play with only these two tables.",

The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”\n\nInterpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest.",

Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain, shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.\n\nEntering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.",

From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often dig into places best left undisturbed.",

The slate-gray cliffs rise dramatically out of the water, topped by treeless moors. Waterfalls, fed by persistent rains, plunge over these cliffs into the raging sea. The winds are fierce and ever-present. In the winter, sleet, snow, and ocean mist can cut visibility to the length of one’s arm.\n\nThe islands are sparsely populated by [Ironlanders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders), mostly fisher-folk who brave the surrounding waters. Their settlements cling to narrow, rock-strewn shores or lie on high overlooks. At night, the dim lights of their fires and torches glimmer pitifully against the wild, storm-tossed sea."

It is the smell of slow death.\n\nA few hardy [Ironlanders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) live here in small settlements built atop hillocks, or in homes standing on stilts over the wetlands. Most fish and forage, making their way among the waterways on flat-bottomed boats propelled by long poles. Some dig through peat for bog iron—a cold, wet, grueling task.\n\nTravel is precarious here. One step has you on solid ground. The next sends you plunging through a thin layer of peat into a murky bog. Then, bony hands reach out to you, grasping, pulling. “Stay with me,” a voice whispers. “Stay with me here in the dark.”"

[Raiders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders/Raider) strike without mercy. The thick woods, deep rivers and dark nights hold secrets and lurking [horrors](Ironsworn/Encounters/Horrors). Some say the Ironlands is a living thing, a malevolent spirit, intent on ridding itself of the human invaders. Slowly, season by season, year by year, it is succeeding.\n\nThe [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) settlements in this region typically stand on hills or at the confluence of rivers. The buildings are made of wood, or sometimes stone, with roofs covered in turf. The central homes and communal structures are protected by an outer palisade fashioned from earth and wood. Outside these walls, from spring through autumn, farmers work the meager fields. In winter, the settlements are smothered by deep snow and oppressive gray clouds."

They try to ward away the encroaching darkness with a blazing fire. They cast nervous glances at sounds just beyond the light.\n\nIn the spring and summer, the melting snow feeds tumultuous rivers.
