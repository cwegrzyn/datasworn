      "Description": "Companions are your NPC helpers. When you acquire a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality. If they don’t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.\n\nCompanions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](ironsworn/moves/suffer/companion_endure_harm) move to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.",

A river primordial is a mass of rock, gravel, and flowing water. A forest primordial is comprised of wood, earth, rocks, and plants. A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice.

Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the [Wilds](ironsworn/encounters/deep_wilds), or high in the ranges of the [Veiled Mountains](ironsworn/regions/veiled_mountains), who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?\n\nPrimordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.\n\nHow do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A [mystic](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders/mystic) might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them.

Atop their heads are sprays of horns which twist and intertwine like slender branches. They roam the forest alone or in small family groups, feeding on lichen, leaves, and other plants. They are not naturally aggressive, but are mighty foes when threatened.\n\nThe color of a gnarl’s bark-like hide changes through its life, emulating the passage of the seasons. A young gnarl’s hide is the verdant green of spring. As they mature, it transitions to the deeper brown-green of summer, then the burnished amber of fall, and finally the cold gray of winter. To protect itself from potential predators, a gnarl will stand among a copse of trees. It will plant its feet, straighten its back, stretch its neck, and stay perfectly still, blending in with its surroundings.\n\nThe low, resonant call of a gnarl can carry for miles. It is a lonely sound, as evocative and heartrending as the most mournful funeral song.",

Then, there are those who wish to forsake the world and live with their memories. For them, an unreal life within the circle is better than the cruel reality outside of it.\n\nThose in need of information may choose to risk a negotiation within a circle.

They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.\n\nThere are three key aspects of using the fate moves:\n  * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.\n  * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.\n  * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.",

They are abstract word prompts you can interpret as appropriate to the current situation and setting. For example, you are traveling through a [Wild](ironsworn/themes/wild) [Tanglewood](ironsworn/domains/tanglewood) and roll “Something unusual or unexpected” on the domain feature table. You then [Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/move/fate/ask_the_oracle) what you discover using the [Aspect](ironsworn/oracles/feature/aspect) and [Focus](ironsworn/oracles/feature/focus) tables. The oracle responds, “Depleted Environment.” Interpreting this answer, you envision coming upon an expanse of cleared forest. All that remains of this once thick woodland is rotted stumps. What happened here? Perhaps the answer lies ahead...",

        "Description": "Use the [Aspect](ironsworn/oracles/feature/aspect) and [Focus](ironsworn/oracles/feature/focus) oracles to generate the details of a location or event within a site, or to answer questions about the site’s nature or history.\n\nThe basic function of these oracles is similar to the Action(ironsworn/oracles/action) and Theme(ironsworn/oracles/theme) oracles in Ironsworn Core. They are abstract word prompts you can interpret as appropriate to the current situation and setting. For example, you are traveling through a [Wild](ironsworn/themes/wild) [Tanglewood](ironsworn/domains/tanglewood) and roll “Something unusual or unexpected” on the domain feature table. You then [Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/move/fate/ask_the_oracle) what you discover using the [Aspect](ironsworn/oracles/feature/aspect) and [Focus](ironsworn/oracles/feature/focus) tables. The oracle responds, “Depleted Environment.” Interpreting this answer, you envision coming upon an expanse of cleared forest. All that remains of this once thick woodland is rotted stumps. What happened here? Perhaps the answer lies ahead...",

      "Description": "These maze-like tunnels are found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold. Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain, shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.\n\nEntering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.",

Some of these sites have been newly adapted by [Ironlanders](ironsworn/encounters/ironlanders) as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.\n\nNewly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.",
