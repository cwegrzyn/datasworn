    summary: The __Ironlanders__ are the humans who have settled these lands.
    description: |-
      Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

      This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can [Ask the Oracle](oracle_rollable:classic/turning_point/challenge_rank), or follow these guidelines:

        * A common citizen or brute is __troublesome__.
        * A trained warrior is __dangerous__.
        * A powerful or veteran warrior is __formidable__.

          Another people sailed to the Ironlands from the [Old World](truth:classic/old_world) long before our kin settled here. Something happened. Something changed them.

          Whether it was the long struggle in a harsh land, the ravages of war, or the corruption of some dark force, they left their humanity behind and became what we call the broken. Now, they exist only to kill, to destroy.

          We fear the broken for their savagery. But, more than this, we fear them as a dark portent of what we might one day become.

They live a nomadic life alone or in small family units, herding oxen, mountain goats, and sheep. In their own language they are called the Jokul.

          Many Ironlanders misinterpret their quiet nature for dullness, but giants are keenly intelligent and observant. They have a great respect for life, even for our kind, and will use trickery and negotiation to avoid a fight. When they are left without other options, an enraged giant is a devastating, relentless force.

          The primordials, said to be the vestigial spirits of long-forgotten gods, are the most ancient of the firstborn. Each embodies some aspect of the natural world, bound in a form which is a crude mimicry of a human or large animal. A river primordial is a mass of rock, gravel, and flowing water. A forest primordial is comprised of wood, earth, rocks, and plants. A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice. A fire primordial, depending on its mood, might take form as embers, ash and smoke—or as a raging pyre.

          They range in size from the height of an Ironlander to half-again as tall as a [giant](npc:classic/firstborn/giant). Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the Wilds, or high in the ranges of the [Veiled Mountains](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/veiled_mountains), who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the [Shattered Wastes](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/shattered_wastes), live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?

          Primordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.

          How do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A mystic might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them. If you see a primordial, keep your distance. Better yet, run.

          Trolls mostly live in the [Flooded Land](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/flooded_lands), but it’s not unusual to encounter one in the [Hinterlands](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/hinterlands) or even in the southern reaches of the [Havens](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/havens). They are solitary creatures, wary of contact with Ironlanders but likely to attack if scared or provoked.

          They move with their back hunched, often skulking on all four gangly limbs. When they stand straight they are much taller than humans—nearly as tall as a giant. Their skin is a sickly pale gray, but they can camouflage themselves by changing it to match their environment.

          Trolls collect objects of all sorts, and particularly value Ironlander trinkets. They are tormented by the fear of others stealing their hoard, and are constantly seeking out new, better hiding places. The items are mostly junk to anyone but a troll, but occasionally an object of real value finds its way into the dregs.

They have fierce, wolf-like features and are broad-shouldered and a head taller than the average Ironlander. Their long hair is ornately groomed and decorated with beads and other trinkets.

          The varou value territory above all things. They often war amongst themselves and against the [elves](npc:classic/firstborn/elf) to gain or defend holdings. They mark their claims by carving clan symbols into trees. Only the foolish ignore the warning of these border signs.

      animals are the mundane creatures which dwell in the Ironlands. Some animals are native to these lands; others were also common in the [Old World](truth:classic/old_world).

      Most wild animals are skittish and do not pose a threat to humans. Those creatures have no rank, and can be attacked or interacted with using appropriate moves. For example, [Resupply](move:classic/adventure/resupply) can represent hunting for deer or small game.

      A few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.

The silver bears of the [Veiled Mountains](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/veiled_mountains), which sometimes range as far south as the [Tempest Hills](atlas_entry:classic/ironlands/tempest_hills), are territorial, powerful, and aggressive. Likewise, the ash bear, encountered in woodlands through the Ironlands, is known for its ferocity and cunning.

          Haunts are restless spirits bound to this world by a traumatic or unjust death. They may be tied to a location, an object, or even a person.

          A haunt who manifests as a physical being can be dispelled by overcoming them in a fight, but only temporarily. They will only be at peace when their death is avenged or resolved. Some say a haunt can be banished, but these rituals are a lost art.

          You are plagued by a haunt. Who is it? What do they want of you?
        your_truth: |-
          When someone dies a violent death, or at the hand of another, they are often laid to rest using a specific, ceremonial rite. This, it is believed, prevents them from returning as a haunt. What is this ritual? What rare material is required?

          It is said that [elves](npc:classic/firstborn/elf) who die an unjust death or have cause to seek retribution can rise as a hollow. Their form is a rippling mass of dead leaves, plants, soil, carrion, and insects. They move with a nightmarish, shambling gait. Their face is the wooden mask they wore in life. Their voice is the rattle of the wind through dry leaves.

          As with [haunts](npc:classic/horrors/haunt), they can be temporarily defeated but cannot be killed by physical means. They are a relentless force. They will not stop until they enact their vengeance.

          Some vows are held so fiercely that they survive even after death. An iron revenant is an incorporeal force of furious resolve, the unfinished vow of an Ironsworn given horrible form as a construct of metal.

          Attacks may slow them down or temporarily break apart their armored form, but they have no flesh to pierce and cannot be killed. An iron revenant will not stop until their vow is fulfilled.

          A sodden is the restless spirit of someone who drowned or was put to rest in water. They can appear in seas, rivers, lakes, ponds or marshes. It is said that their loneliness compels them to draw living victims into their watery lairs.

          A sodden is not confined to its resting place. In fact, some believe that surviving an encounter with a sodden will leave you vulnerable around any body of water until the spirit finishes its work.

          Someone you know died and appears to you as a sodden. Who are they? Can anything be done to put them to rest?
        your_truth: |-
          Many Ironlanders habitually perform a quick ritual when near a body of water, believing it keeps any lurking sodden at bay. What do they do? Is there any truth to this custom?
