              When you defeat a notable ship or sea beast, envision the trophy you take. Then, add it to a list of trophies on display in your ship’s vault. When you make a move to overcome an obstacle or hazard at sea, you may use the imbued power of a trophy to reroll any dice. If you do, mark that trophy’s power as spent.

              As above, and if you you use a trophy to reroll all dice and score a strong hit with a match, the legacy of that object favors you; mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track, and do not mark the trophy as spent. If you instead score a miss with a match, envision the cursed legacy that now haunts you.

              When you give a tour of the vault and make a move in that space to impress or intimidate, add +2 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
