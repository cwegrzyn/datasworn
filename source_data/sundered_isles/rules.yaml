  #       Equipped supply represents readiness among you and your allies: gear, weapons and ammo, provisions when going ashore, and minor finances. Think of it as your personal supplyâ€”the things you and your allies count among your equipment, belongings, and coin at hand.

  #     label: supply (hold)

  #     description: |-
  #       Hold supply represents shipwide resources such as food and water, rum, gear and tools, weapons for the crew, ammo and powder for the cannons, oil for the lamps, wood and sailcloth for repairs, and minor trade goods. It measures your level of readiness for seagoing journeys and naval combat, and your ability to keep the crew provisioned and equipped. If you find yourself commanding multiple ships, the single hold supply value measures your fleetwide readiness.

You are not properly equipped for the dangers of the Sundered Isles. Because you and your allies share the same supply value, you mark unprepared together.
