          __When you sail an unfamiliar route through perilous seas, find the way across hazardous terrain, or explore a mysterious site__, give the expedition a name and rank.

          Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you...

            * Move at speed: Roll +edge
            * Keep a low profile: Roll +shadow
            * Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

          On a __strong hit__, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

          On a __weak hit__, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.

            * Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer moves (-1).
            * Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

          On a __miss__, you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and [Pay the Price](move:starforged/fate/pay_the_price).

    # When you Repair and score a hit, you gain repair points. This is a limited resource used only within the scope of the move to prioritize and make repairs. The amount of repair points you earn varies according to the situation and the outcome of the move, per the included table. Here's a summary of those situations.

    # At a Facility
    # Serviced by a dockyard or other facility—not making your own repairs.

    # At Anchor Making your own repairs while docked, anchored, or encamped—with sufficient time to give the repairs proper attention.

    # Underway Making your own repairs while traveling or under time pressure.

    # Under Fire
    # Making your own repairs in a crisis, such as during combat, while navigating a hazardous environment, under extreme time pressure, or dealing with life-and-death repair issues.
