          These tables help inspire locations, events, and encounters on a seafaring expedition. Use the [Known Waters](id:sundered_isles/oracles/seafaring/waypoints/known_waters) table if you [Undertake an Expedition](id:sundered_isles/moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) among or between known islands, such as when following a chart of local islands. Use the [Unknown Waters](id:sundered_isles/oracles/seafaring/waypoints/unknown_waters) table when navigating seas with the prospect of encountering unrevealed islands.
