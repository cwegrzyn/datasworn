These unfortunate beasts are infested by a multitude of parasites that bind grasping tendrils to flesh and bone. The small creatures steal the life of their host and puppeteer what remains.

It has the sleek form and speed of a giant whale, but is armed with powerful tentacles and a gaping, toothy maw. Along its flank are rows of luminescent eyes; doom lights, mariners call them, for they are a presage of certain death.

Its rotating maw generates powerful whirlpools to draw in prey, sending ship and sailor alike into an ever-burning furnace deep within its mechanical gullet.

Islanders interpret wondrous and grim portents from the sighting of a herald, but these creatures often go unseen; their craggy shell is easily mistaken for a small, rocky island.

Despite its legendary reputation, the thundermaw prefers to scavenge its meals, and tires easily when giving chase.

It is taller than the highest jungle canopy, and leaves trails of splintered trees and sundered earth in its wake.

When a trespasser comes near, they use a chittering call and display of colorful plumage to warn them away. If that fails, their surprising jumping ability, razor-like claws, and sharp beak make quick work of any threat.

The largest and oldest of a herd, the matriarch, is covered in a layer of moss, lichen, and plant sprigs—it wears this lush garden like an elaborate, earthy cape.

                text: Sand Dragon
                text2: Formidable
                text3: Sand dragons are the smallest of dragon-kind, but are still a fearsome foe. Burrowing beneath shoreline dunes, it stirs at the telltale vibrations of footfalls upon its lair. It attacks with dagger-like claws, teeth as long and wicked as cutlasses, and breath of scalding steam.

                text2: Extreme
                text3: The keelback crab uses a scavenged ship as a protective shell for its soft exoskeleton. Reports of ghost ships can often be attributed to keelbacks, scuttling along coastal waters with wrecks on their backs. As it grows, a keelback must commandeer vessels of increasing size.

                text2: Extreme
                text3: The jade crab is the largest and most aggressive of the crustaceans, able to snap a longboat or even a small ship in two with its vice-like pincers. At rest, their shell is slate gray, easily mistaken for rocks or reefs. On the hunt, they shimmer with an iridescent blue-green. Fiercely territorial, these creatures often claim a waterway, cove, or sea cave as their lair.

                text3: Various types of enormous hawks hunt among the isles, including the mangrove-dwelling ash hawk and the coastal wind reaver. The greatest of them, the fabled vastwing, is said to be capable of grasping and lifting a fully loaded longboat in its enormous talons.

                text3: The most common dragon of the isles, the iron dragon dwells in a variety of environments, from rocky coasts to deep inland jungles. They have a tough hide the color of weathered iron, dreadful claws, and a long, powerful tail. But their most potent weapon is their fiery breath, the bane of any wooden ship that earns their ire. Some island folk revere these creatures. But others harness them and ride into battle, launching from a seaside fort or a ship’s deck to lay waste to their enemies.

                text2: Formidable
                text3: These oversized bats, large enough to carry off an unlucky islander, dwell in caves and amid jungle canopies. As the sun sets, they leave their roosts to hunt. They are particularly dangerous on moonless nights when their swift, silent approach goes unnoticed.

                text3: These moth-like creatures are unsettlingly large but harmless. They are often seen on nights when Wraith is full—they shimmer with a strange, ethereal glow, as if reflecting the light of the moon. Many islanders believe they escort souls into the world beyond. Look too long into their alluring glow, they say, and you suffer a glimpse of your own death.
