                text2: Various Ranks
                text3: Most sharks offer little threat, but certain species of large, aggressive sharks are properly feared and respected by seagoing folk. Mariners also speak of ancient sharks, relentless hunters the size of whales whose teeth splinter hull and bone alike.

                text2: Epic
                text3: These ancient whales are far larger and more aggressive than their common kin. Their bone-white hide bears the scars of harpoon strikes and hard-won battles with other beasts. They are keenly intelligent, have long memories, and do not forgive or forget.

                text3: Circling carrion birds and the stench of death often forewarn the appearance of a rothulk, a cadaverous but still animate great whale. These unfortunate beasts are infested by a multitude of parasites that bind grasping tendrils to flesh and bone. The small creatures steal the life of their host and puppeteer what remains.

                text: The Kraken
                text2: Epic
                text3: The Kraken is the singular master of the seas, a beast of horrific scale, cunning, and ferocity. It has the sleek form and speed of a giant whale, but is armed with powerful tentacles and a gaping, toothy maw. Along its flank are rows of luminescent eyes; doom lights, mariners call them, for they are a presage of certain death.

                text2: Formidable
                text3: These aquatic dragons have glittering scales, toothy jaws, and long, bladed tails. Their winglike fins propel them through the water at amazing speeds, and send them leaping and gliding over the waves.

                text2: Formidable
                text3: These masses of black-eyed, sharp-toothed eels rely on sheer numbers to overwhelm larger prey. Some say they are capable of chewing through a ship’s hull, and pour into a breached vessel in a slithering, biting torrent.
              - roll: { min: 71, max: 75 }
                text: Sea Serpent
                text2: Epic
                text3: These titanic beasts have sinuous bodies, glittering scales, and spiny red fins larger than the greatest mainsail. They are largely ambivalent to the presence of most seagoing folk—all but the largest ship passes beneath their notice.

                text3: Hundreds of pinpoint lights shimmer within the translucent form of these gigantic jellyfish. According to legend, the lights of a starlume reveal complex celestial maps. Those who look deeply into those alluring lights may find themselves gifted—or cursed—with visions of lost seas and hidden places.

                text2: Epic
                text3: From a distance, this titanic entity might be mistaken for a great whale, but it is a crewless metal construct that wanders the seas on an inscrutable mission. Its rotating maw generates powerful whirlpools to draw in prey, sending ship and sailor alike into an ever-burning furnace deep within its mechanical gullet.

                text2: Epic
                text3: These colossal tortoise-like beings are the longest-lived creatures of the isles—perhaps as ancient as the world itself. Islanders interpret wondrous and grim portents from the sighting of a herald, but these creatures often go unseen; their craggy shell is easily mistaken for a small, rocky island.

When a trespasser comes near, they use a chittering call and display of colorful plumage to warn them away. If that fails, their surprising jumping ability, razor-like claws, and sharp beak make quick work of any threat.
