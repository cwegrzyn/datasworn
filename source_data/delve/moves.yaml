          When __you resolve to enter a perilous site in pursuit of an objective__, choose the theme and domain which best represent its nature ([Ask the Oracle](move:classic/fate/ask_the_oracle) if unsure), and give it a rank.

            * Troublesome site: 3 progress per area.
            * Dangerous site: 2 progress per area.
            * Formidable site: 1 progress per area.
            * Extreme site: 2 ticks per area.
            * Epic site: 1 tick per area.

          If you are returning to a previously explored site, roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes.

    description: |-
      History is often chronicled through objects of power. Wars and accords, struggles and triumphs, love and hate, sacrifice and death—these legacies can imbue objects with cultural importance and supernatural gifts.

      In __Ironsworn__, these items are called *rarities*. They may be handed down through generations, lost or hidden away in the depths of perilous sites, coveted by powerful forces, or forgotten and discarded. When you obtain a rarity through the course of your story, you gain a subtle but lasting impact on your character and their abilities.
