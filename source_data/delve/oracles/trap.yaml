    summary: Identify the characteristics and effects of a trap within a site.
    # TODO: replace the page ref for scene challenges to an article on the topic, once that's available
    description: |-
      If you encounter a trap within a site, use these oracles to better understand the nature or function of this obstacle. Roll once for an [Event](id:delve/oracles/trap/event) and once for a [Component](id:delve/oracles/trap/component), and interpret the response as appropriate to the situation and environment. A trap might be a physical, supernatural, or an ambush by a denizen.

      If you are in a position to overcome or avoid the trap, make moves to see what happens. A simple trap might be dealt with in a single action, such as through the [Face Danger](id:classic/moves/adventure/face_danger) move. A complex trap could be represented as a scene challenge (*Ironsworn Core*, page 234).
