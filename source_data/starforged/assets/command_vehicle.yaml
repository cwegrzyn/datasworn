    summary: This is your interstellar spacecraft.
    description: |-
      The __command vehicle__ is your interstellar STARSHIP. It is a default asset for your character, taken when you begin your campaign. If you are playing with others, this is a shared asset; each of you may use the STARSHIP's abilities while aboard the craft.

      The command vehicle has an integrity meter and starts at 5 integrity. When your STARSHIP takes a hit, make the [Withstand Damage](id:starforged/moves/suffer/withstand_damage) move to see what happens.
