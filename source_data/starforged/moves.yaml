      __Session moves__ provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions.
    description: |-
      The __session moves__ fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

      Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

          __When you begin a significant session or chapter of play__, do all of the following.

            * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](id:starforged/move/session/set_a_flag).
            * Review or recap what happened last session.
            * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

          In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

            * __Reframe:__ This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
            * __Refocus:__ This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
            * __Replace:__ This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
            * __Redirect:__ Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
            * __Reshape:__ The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

    summary: Make these __quest moves__ when you swear vows, make progress on your quests, and resolve vows.
    description: |-
      In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.
