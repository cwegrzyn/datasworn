    summary: Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within an unusual, aberrant, or important location.
    description: |-
      Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within an unusual, aberrant, or important location.

      Each theme on the following pages includes a set of oracles.

        * __Feature:__ Use this table to reveal a new aspect of the location.
        * __Peril:__ Use this table to help envision a complication or hazard.
        * __Opportunity:__ Use this table to help envision a beneficial encounter or event, such as when rolling a strong hit with a match in a location.

      You can answer questions about a place using only the tables provided for a theme, such as when delving into an [Infested](oracle_collection:starforged/location_themes/infested) cave. Or pair a theme with other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might explore a [Haunted](oracle_collection:starforged/location_themes/haunted) [Grave World](oracle_collection:starforged/planets/grave), a [Ruined](oracle_collection:starforged/location_themes/ruined) [Derelict](oracle_collection:starforged/derelicts), a [Sacred](oracle_collection:starforged/location_themes/sacred) [Precursor Vault](oracle_collection:starforged/vaults), or an [Inhabited](oracle_collection:starforged/location_themes/inhabited) [Settlement](oracle_collection:starforged/settlements).

      When mixing-and-matching a theme with another set of tables, use the techniques described for an __oracle array__ (page 384) to determine which oracle you reference for that question or phase of your exploration.
