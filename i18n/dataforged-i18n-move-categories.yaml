  A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.

  Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate before a council, or competing in a hoverbike race.

    * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Starforged/Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
    * Review or recap what happened last session.

  In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.
