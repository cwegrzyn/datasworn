Ironsworn/Moves/Fate#Description: |-
  In solo and co-op play, the fate moves mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places and events external to your character, the fate moves help you discover an answer.

  In guided mode, your GM represents the whims of fate. They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.

  There are three key aspects of using the fate moves:
    * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.
    * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.
    * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.

  When **you make a move aided by an augmented asset**, roll your rarity die in place of your action die.

  On a **hit** with 5 showing on the rarity die, the power of the rarity manifests in a subtle way. Take +1 momentum.

  On a **miss** with 1 showing on the rarity die, the rarityâ€™s power fails or works against you.
Ironsworn/Moves/Rarity#Description: |-
  History is often chronicled through objects of power. Wars and accords, struggles and triumphs, love and hate, sacrifice and deathâ€”these legacies can imbue objects with cultural importance and supernatural gifts.

  In **Ironsworn**, these items are called *rarities*. They may be handed down through generations, lost or hidden away in the depths of perilous sites, coveted by powerful forces, or forgotten and discarded. When you obtain a rarity through the course of your story, you gain a subtle but lasting impact on your character and their abilities.

  The world does not wait for you. As you undertake journeys to distant locations, explore perilous places, and spend time recovering from your adventures, the forces which oppose you will advance their own agenda. When you suffer setbacks, those forces will take advantage of your failure to gain new ground.

  **Threats** are an optional mechanic for your *Ironsworn* campaign which will make the forces in your world more active and responsive. Your vows will gain new urgency as threats work against you.
