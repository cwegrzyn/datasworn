Starforged/Encounters/Chiton/Chiton_Queen#Description: The chiton queen is a massive creature with segmented pincers, an armored carapace, and a bulging, egg-carrying abdomen. From the depths of the nest, it commands its drones telepathically. This psychic communication is so powerful it can even breach human consciousness—troubling dreams and waking hallucinations might be the harbinger of a chiton invasion.

Starforged/Encounters/Chiton#Description: The chiton are not native to any single planet, and are adaptable to most environments. Some suggest they are an ancient precursor bioweapon seeded across the galaxy. The larva of the telepathic queen can lay dormant for thousands of years, emerging only when its sleep is disturbed by the mental energies of intelligent life. An awoken queen quickly metamorphoses into its adult form and lays its first clutch of eggs. Soon after, newly-hatched drones set out to expand the nest and feed their ravenous progenitor.

  The colossi are titanic humanoid machines created by a long-dead civilization. We do not know their original purpose. Perhaps they were weapons built for conquest in a ancient war, or mighty devices designed to explore new worlds.

  Most colossi are found inactive—frozen in icy wastes, overgrown within verdant jungles, entombed in the depths of fathomless seas. Their armored shell is resistant to time and harsh environments, and they are nearly as imposing and majestic as the day they were forged.

  Rarely, a colossus awakens to carry out its inscrutable purpose. They stride across the landscape of alien worlds, shaking the ground with each massive footfall. These active colossi ignore our attempts at communication and bat away our ineffectual attacks—the technology that powers them is beyond our understanding.

  Crystallids are beautiful but dangerous crystalline lifeforms that take a variety of sizes and shapes. Some are small and insect-like, skittering across the surface of rugged worlds or within cavernous depths. Others are much larger than a human, with a vaguely bestial form. A few can even sprout multifaceted wings to take to the air. Their lustrous coloration changes to mimic their environment, and they often appear as simply a part of the landscape until an unwitting explorer happens across them.

  Crystallids are mineral hoarders. Their hidden burrows hold a cache of precious stones and valuable ores. For this reason, explorers and prospectors often attempt to track crystallids back to their nest. “The bigger the crystallid, the better the haul,” is a common saying among those audacious fortune hunters. But that potential motherlode is not taken without risk—crystallids are fierce protectors of their hoard.

What's left is discarded or sold on the black market. A typical pirate cutlass is a haphazard collection of parts, splashed with the colors and sigils of their commanders, built for speed and brutish power. The imposing sight of one of these fierce vessels is enough to send a chill through the heart of even the boldest spacer.

  Drifts provide the means of interstellar travel across the Forge–but also offer myriad dangers for spacers. Chief among those threats are drift pirates: reavers and thieves who prowl eidolon passages and anchorages to seize ships and cargo for their own.

  These pirates often live short, brutal lives, or survive long enough to see their near-constant exposure to drift energies and unshielded eidolon drives manifest as strange mutations. Despite that, most would not trade their chosen path for one of comfort or safety.

  For some spacers, sighting these strange, spectral creatures on a spaceborne journey is a portent of a change in fortune. A few even profess to divine meaning from their elaborate, luminous dance, as people of old would interpret omens by studying the flight of birds. Others refer to the wisps as corpse lights, believing they are the spirits of ancient beings cursed to linger forever within the cold void between stars.

  Less superstitious spacers swear on various methods of “shooing” wisps away—everything from cycling the engines to cutting power entirely for a minute or so and allowing the creatures to move on.

  Two wing-like appendages fan out from the back of the flarewing's head. Each is studded with sensory nerves to detect the subtlest of movement, and tipped with bioluminescent lures.

  Ghosts might manifest in a physical form or assault with physical force, but they cannot be defeated through violence. To vanquish a ghost, you must instead find the key to unshackle them from our reality.

  The bane of all spacers, the cable-chewing vermin known as gnawlings are a common pest aboard starships throughout the Forge. Adept at navigating in low or zero gravity with their long, multi-jointed limbs, these creatures emerge from cargo holds and engineering bays to gather and consume food. It’s said a gnawling could digest an eidolon drive, and there’s some truth to that adage—their digestive systems barely differentiate between organic and inorganic material.

  Though not a grave threat individually, if left to their own devices, gnawlings are capable of quickly overrunning even large vessels. More than a few horror stories exist of scavengers cracking the airlock seal on a derelict only to find it crawling with thousands of these vile, chittering things.

  Unnervingly, the howlcat’s heavy skull possesses no eyes. Instead, it is crowned by large ears and a glossy bioacoustic organ. Through its distinct, chilling call, it uses echolocation to perceive its surroundings and stalk its prey with uncanny precision.

  When the vine encounters a potential victim, it lashes out, entangling them, cutting into their flesh with hollow thorns. It uses those thorns to implant microscopic seeds. After a few hours, the seeds mature and sprout. Unless stopped, the fast-growing tendrils course greedily through the victim's body, consuming the fluids within.

Its outer shell and plated wings protect it from heat and flame, but it is pitted and scarred by innumerable collisions with airborne volcanic fragments. Its most fearsome aspect is a segmented tail, which it uses to deliver a powerful, paralyzing toxin to its unfortunate prey.

  They are asexual and solitary creatures, and mark the bounds of their hunting grounds with intricate cairns built from the bones of their victims. If a rival pyralis passes overhead, the sight of that marker is forewarning that they are straying into another's domain.

Starforged/Encounters/Risen/Chimera#Description: When many beings perish in the same site, the chaotic forces of the Forge can create a chimera—multiple undead bodies fused into a twisted, massive entity that knows only pain and hunger. When a dozen blood-tinged eyes focus on you, when the gibbering mouths open at once to scream, your only hope is a quick death.

Starforged/Encounters/Risen#Description: |-
  In the Forge, strange energies, alien contagions, and ancient, esoteric technologies can sunder the divide between life and death. Often found in places of great destruction or suffering—battlefields, derelict ships, the ruins of forsaken settlements—the risen protect their place of death fiercely and eternally.

  To say the risen hate the living is untrue; to hate something would require sentience, emotion. Risen are robotic in their duties, automatic in their violence. They wield the weapons they carried in life to better harm their foes, and when that fails, they rake with bony, claw-like fingers. Their garments hang in bloodstained tatters. Their emaciated flesh, stretched taught over their misshapen bones, only hints at the living, breathing human they were before this curse befell them.

  Many spacers spin tales of shambling risen encountered on abandoned colony worlds or derelict space cruisers. But perhaps most horrifyingly, it’s said the risen can survive decades in the vacuum of space before latching onto a passing ship or attacking engineers making exterior repairs.

Starforged/Encounters/Scrap_Bandit/Hover_Prowlers#Description: Teams of bandits, riding jerry-built hoverbikes and skiffs, are the vanguard for planetside raids. They scout settlement defenses, ride as escort for the clan's war rig, and create chaos to overrun defenders.

Starforged/Encounters/Scrap_Bandit/War_Rig#Description: At the onset of a raid, a scrap bandit clan's war rig is deployed by a heavy transport ship beyond a settlement's defenses. These mobile fortresses vary in form and function—some use hover tech, others thunder across the landscape on wheels or treads, a few trudge along on articulated metal legs. All are heavily armored, bristling with weapons, and fiercely defended by the bandits. The mere sight of the rig as it approaches is often enough for a settlement to surrender and agree to any demand.
Starforged/Encounters/Scrap_Bandit#Description: Scrap bandits roam the fringes of settled sectors, preying on planetside outposts. They survive by seizing provisions, resources, and equipment from those places. Because these raiders tend to revisit fruitful settlements, they do what they can to avoid razing them to the ground or leaving the settlers with less than they need to survive. “Never let a field go fallow,” is a common scrap bandit expression.

Starforged/Encounters/Servitor/Enforcer#Description: Though most often encountered as labor and service units, many servitors are deployed as brutes, guards, and soldiers. Their resistance to damage and survivability in harsh environs makes them ideal fighters for those who can afford them. Enforcers are often used by tyrannical factions to keep settlements passive and productive.

Starforged/Encounters/Servitor#Description: |-
  The inhospitable environments and dangerous sites of the Forge sometimes prove too volatile for even the most dogged spacers—and that’s where servitors come in.

  Servitors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often built to serve a specific duty—everything from loading cargo to surveying systems to boarding enemy ships. These bots sometimes possess lifelike qualities, like speech synthesizers or face-plates made to mimic expressions, to better endear them to humans. Others are given frightful or intimidating features, to better keep those humans in line.

  Rarely, a servitor will live to outgrow its programming, and begin the process of gaining sentience to forge its own path. These awoken bots are feared or misunderstood by many, but can sometimes find a home for themselves on starship crews or on fringe settlements where they earn the trust and friendship of their peers.

Starforged/Encounters/Sicklehorn#Description: |-
  The sicklehorn are mammalian herd animals bred by settlers throughout the Forge. They are adaptable to most climates and terrain, have iron constitutions, and are prized for the versatile and valuable milk produced by their females. Aside from its nutritive properties, the milk can be processed in a number of ways to manufacture potent medicines and powerful narcotics.

  A herd of sicklehorn are often sent with groups attempting to found a new planetside settlement. With careful breeding, the settlers can produce enough meat and milk to sustain themselves and trade for needed supplies. But sicklehorn are range animals, and raiders and rustlers often target a vulnerable herd. The creatures—especially a matriarch—are a valuable commodity.

Starforged/Encounters/Sky_Roost/Roost_Swarm#Description: When a roost is threatened, the symbiotic lifeforms it shelters mobilize to protect their home. The compulsion to defend the roost is so strong that the swarm's instinct for self preservation is suppressed. They attack in a fierce cyclone of wing, teeth, and claw.
Starforged/Encounters/Sky_Roost/Title#Canonical: Sky Roost
Starforged/Encounters/Sky_Roost/Title#Short: Sky Roost
Starforged/Encounters/Sky_Roost/Title#Standard: Sky Roost
Starforged/Encounters/Sky_Roost#Description: |-
  Sky roosts are massive creatures that drift in the buoyant upper atmosphere of a Jovian world. Their broad, scalloped mantle unfurls to catch updrafts as sinuous feelers extract water, minerals, and organisms from the dense cloud layers below.

  A roost's wide cap and warm, glowing core shelters a complex ecosystem of other lifeforms. A few of these resident creatures live out their entire lives within the refuge of a single roost; others come and go as they hunt within the Jovian skies or migrate among distant habitats.

  Roosts are enormous and long-lived, but fragile. In a symbiotic trade for shelter, the inhabitants provide protection against large predators and other threats, and their discarded food and waste help fuel the roost's sluggish metabolism.

  As a roost navigates the currents and eddies of the Jovian atmosphere, the expansion and contraction of its internal air bladders is heard as a deep, resounding call. As other roosts respond, the shared, plaintive song reverberates among the clouds.

Inside, the gelatinous mass of the technoplasm slithers through darkened corridors. Tendrils of the ooze bore into bulkheads and machinery like marbleized fat through a chunk of meat.

  Theorized to be a precursor bioweapon that persisted long beyond the death of its creators, technoplasm is a malignant lifeform that infects, mutates, and controls machines, robots, and computer systems.

  Technoplasm infestations are tenacious, cunning, and dangerous to eliminate. When in doubt, burn it and deal with the aftermath that comes with generous applications of fire. A ship or settlement with a large outbreak is likely too far gone and best abandoned, although some suggest every infection has its source; if you somehow find and destroy the heart of a technoplasm infestation, can you kill it entirely?

  Many spacers tell stories of being aided by a void shepherd pod. These creatures have an extraordinary intuition, and can escort a wayward spacer back to the right path, guide them away from danger, or lead them toward unseen opportunities.

  When threatened, shepherds charge and ram with their armored snouts. If this doesn't dissuade their foe, a pod harmonizes their energy output to unleash a burst of electromagnetic force; this attack can daze a creature or knock out a ship's critical systems.

  The origin of these long-lived humans is a secret lost to time. Whether through precursor tech, alien organisms, or genetic mutation, they were modified with unnatural strength, endurance, and survivability. They can withstand the harshest of environments. Their wounds heal quickly. They are resistant to sickness and disease.

  More than a century ago, the wardens served as elite soldiers, protecting the people of the Forge against the many threats of this galaxy. But as often happens, their purpose was subverted by those who sought to wield them as weapons. Conflicts flared among powerful factions. Wardens faced their comrades on innumerable battlefields. The chaos might have ended us all, had not the wardens rebelled against those who used them as cogs in the machines of war.

Starforged/Encounters/Water_Witcher#Description: |-
  Water is life. On rugged planets in fringe sectors, the technology to locate fresh water or process contaminated water is not always available or reliable. Many struggling settlements resort to a low-tech solution—a dowser and their waterwitcher companion.

  Waterwitchers are stout, furred creatures with fierce-looking retractable claws on their forelegs. On their homeworld, which was lost a decade ago in a stellar calamity, they used those claws to dig through the arid, rocky ground, and had an unerring knack for finding hidden water sources. Some of the human settlers who fled the doomed planet adopted waterwitchers as companions, and now travel the Forge with their furry friends in tow.

  Waterwitchers were a precious part of their ecosystem, and were not preyed upon by other creatures. This made them gentle and trusting to a fault. They often greet potential new friends with enthusiastic sniffing and contented purring. For their dowser companions, it's an unrelenting effort to keep them out of trouble.

Starforged/Encounters/Worldbreaker#Description: |-
  The scale and strength of the worldbreakers is so beyond our reckoning that some consider them godlike beings. Capable of thriving on verdant jungle worlds, frozen planets, worlds scorched by volcanic activity, and even within barren asteroids in the vacuum of space, these worms possess a wisdom and a cunning that makes them a deadly threat for even the most competent spacer.

  Worldbreakers range in size from about the size of a cargo hauler to an unfathomable scale that dwarfs our largest starship. They bore tunnels to pursue their prey, and hibernate in those dark depths to conserve energy. Though blind, worldbreaker worms can detect even the subtlest of footfalls, and they follow these vibrations to eventually consume their quarry—along with any other creatures, starships, or structures that happen to be nearby.
