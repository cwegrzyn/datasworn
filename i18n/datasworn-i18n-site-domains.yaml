Ironsworn/Domains/Barrow#Description: |-
  In this cruel land, there is no shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

  Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost, and vows unfulfilled.

  These maze-like tunnels are found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold. Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain, shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

  Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

  An Icereach is an expanse of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast icereaches—kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog the seas in southern regions.

  Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships, locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these places and were forever lost.
