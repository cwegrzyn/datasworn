  Most bears are not aggressive. They avoid [Ironlanders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) and are unlikely to attack unless they see you as a threat.

  There are exceptions. The silver bears of the [Veiled Mountains](Ironsworn/Regions/Veiled_Mountains), which sometimes range as far south as the [Tempest Hills](Ironsworn/Regions/Tempest_Hills), are territorial, powerful, and aggressive. Likewise, the ash bear, encountered in [woodlands](Ironsworn/Domains/Tanglewood) through the Ironlands, is known for its ferocity and cunning. If either catch the scent of you on the wind, they are likely to hunt you down and attack.

  A mature adult grows to the length of a horse. They are ungainly on land, but fast and agile within the water. They prefer to attack landbound prey by lurking along the water’s edge and waiting for an unfortunate animal (or [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders)) to come near their hiding spot.

  Carrion newts lay their eggs within the carcass of their kills. The rotting body nurtures the eggs and feeds the young newts until they burst forth into the world. If you come upon a corpse at the water’s edge—be cautious. It might be filled with dozens of hungry young newts.

They typically feed on bats and rodents, but are opportunistic hunters and attack anything straying into their path or stumbling into their webbing. Their lairs are often strung with large silk egg sacs.

  For smaller animals, the toxic bite of the nightmare spider causes paralysis. For a typical [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders), it dulls the senses and induces vivid hallucinations. It is these frightening, dreamlike visions which earn the creature its name.

When potential prey strays near, a shroud crab uses its powerful legs to spring at its victim. Then, it wraps around them in a horrible embrace, stabbing and slashing with its claws and barbed tail.

  Packs of shroud crabs are known to work in tandem to bring down large prey. Some report seeing mighty elk engulfed by these voracious creatures. On occasion, the body of a missing [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) is found with their flesh picked clean to the bones.

The stones hunger for new knowledge, and our memories are fodder for their insatiable appetites. What they take is sometimes gone forever.

  Some [Ironlanders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) enter a circle willingly. Perhaps they hope to abandon a painful memory to the stones, discarding that piece of themselves like slag hammered from wrought iron. Then, there are those who wish to forsake the world and live with their memories. For them, an unreal life within the circle is better than the cruel reality outside of it.

  The path the glimmer reveals is not wholly of our world. It can descend into the past, or climb into the future. It can wend its way across other lands and through strange realities. These trails are navigated not just by the glimmer, but by ancient, baneful things beyond comprehension.

  If you accept a glimmer’s guidance, steel yourself for the journey. Envision the places and people that give you hope, and you may find yourself among them. But do not be distracted.

At twilight and during the long gray days of winter, it emerges from its lightless refuge to sate its hunger.

  The gloom’s amorphous form cannot exert physical force. Instead, it will draw in its victims through illusion, mimicking familiar voices or forms. Or it will use the cover of darkness to ambush unwary prey. Once enveloped, the victim is a captive audience for the gloom’s apparitions, forced to face their innermost doubts and fears. The gloom picks at their sanity like a scavenger cleaning meat from bones. After a time, there is nothing left but an empty shell.

  Chitters are unnaturally large insects which dwell underground, nesting in subterranean [caves](Ironsworn/Domains/Cavern), [ruins](Ironsworn/Domains/Ruin) and [barrows](Ironsworn/Domains/Barrow). They stand half the height of an [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders), and move on six segmented legs.

  They are primarily scavengers, using their keen sense of smell to locate and retrieve carcasses above or below ground. Instead of eyes, chitters have three thumb-sized holes in the center of their heads through which they issue a distinctive twittering sound. This call is used to communicate with others of its kind and to help visualize their surroundings—much like bats find their way in darkness.

  They are covered in a rigid shell, and their mandibles are as sharp and destructive as a finely forged blade. They are not necessarily hostile, but will aggressively defend their nests or fight to secure a food source.

  As a last resort, a chitter may attack by spewing the contents of its stomach in a noxious spray, leaving all but the hardiest of Ironlanders temporarily blinded and retching.

  Gnarls dwell in woodlands throughout the Ironlands. The tallest of them are nearly the height of towering trees, with a long neck and legs as stout as trunks. Atop their heads are sprays of horns which twist and intertwine like slender branches. They roam the forest alone or in small family groups, feeding on lichen, leaves, and other plants. They are not naturally aggressive, but are mighty foes when threatened.

  The color of a gnarl’s bark-like hide changes through its life, emulating the passage of the seasons. A young gnarl’s hide is the verdant green of spring. As they mature, it transitions to the deeper brown-green of summer, then the burnished amber of fall, and finally the cold gray of winter. To protect itself from potential predators, a gnarl will stand among a copse of trees. It will plant its feet, straighten its back, stretch its neck, and stay perfectly still, blending in with its surroundings.

  The low, resonant call of a gnarl can carry for miles. It is a lonely sound, as evocative and heartrending as the most mournful funeral song.

A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice. A fire primordial, depending on its mood, might take form as embers, ash and smoke—or as a raging pyre.

  They range in size from the height of an [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) to half-again as tall as a giant. Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the [Wilds](Ironsworn/Encounters/Deep_Wilds), or high in the ranges of the [Veiled Mountains](Ironsworn/Regions/Veiled_Mountains), who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?

  Primordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.

  How do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A [mystic](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders/Mystic) might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them. If you see a primordial, keep your distance. Better yet, run.

  Trolls mostly live in the [Flooded Lands](Ironsworn/Regions/Flooded_Lands), but it’s not unusual to encounter one in the [Hinterlands](Ironsworn/Regions/Hinterlands) or even in the southern reaches of the [Havens](Ironsworn/Regions/Havens). They are solitary creatures, wary of contact with [Ironlanders](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) but likely to attack if scared or provoked.

  They move with their back hunched, often skulking on all four gangly limbs. When they stand straight they are much taller than humans—nearly as tall as a giant. Their skin is a sickly pale gray, but they can camouflage themselves by changing it to match their environment.

  Trolls collect objects of all sorts, and particularly value [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders) trinkets. They are tormented by the fear of others stealing their hoard, and are constantly seeking out new, better hiding places. The items are mostly junk to anyone but a troll, but occasionally an object of real value finds its way into the dregs.

They have fierce, wolf-like features and are broad-shouldered and a head taller than the average [Ironlander](Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlanders). Their long hair is ornately groomed and decorated with beads and other trinkets.

  The varou value territory above all things. They often war amongst themselves and against the [elves](Ironsworn/Encounters/Firstborn/Elf) to gain or defend holdings. They mark their claims by carving clan symbols into trees. Only the foolish ignore the warning of these border signs. Several of our settlements—built too close to varou territory—are now abandoned ruins bearing the mark of a victorious varou clan.

  Long ago, before we arrived on the shores of the Ironlands, other people lived here. Some of those folk dwelled in what we now call the [Flooded Lands](Ironsworn/Regions/Flooded_Lands), and laid their kin to rest in the vast peat bogs of that place.

  A few of those dead do not rest, and rise as bog rots. They are horrible creatures, with preserved flesh stained and withered like old leather. Their eyes are black pits, and their mouths hang open in a perpetual, silent scream.

  It is said a bog rot can only find rest by committing another victim to the mire. A soul for a soul. In those final moments, the creature whispers of ancient secrets and forbidden lore, as if unloading the burden of that dark knowledge. For those few who escape the grasp of a bog rot, these awful truths are sometimes worse than death.

At the heart of a horde, surrounded by layers of clattering bones, are the remains of the spiteful being who gives the horror its cruel intelligence.

  Its form varies. In tight spaces, a bonehorde may appear as an amorphous mound or as a spider-like entity with long, skittering limbs. In the open, it can crudely mimic the shape of an animal or person. The bones constantly shift—snapping like dry twigs—to accommodate its environment, propel its movement, and lash out against its victims.

Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlander/Mystic#Description: Some say you can tell a mystic by looking them in the eye. They walk in two worlds, and their eyes shimmer with that dark reflection of realms beyond our own. We call it the sight. Some hold that darkness in check. Others are consumed by it.

Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlander/Zealot/Title#Standard: Zealot
Ironsworn/Encounters/Ironlander/Zealot#Description: |-
  Zealots are those we have lost to their faith. Friends and loved ones are discarded or forgotten. Communities are left behind. Possessions are discarded or turned over to the needs of the sect. They live for one purpose, and all other vows are forsaken. This single-minded devotion changes them, sometimes irrevocably.

  Some zealots worship ancient, forgotten gods, and seek to return them to their former horrible glory. Others serve new religious movements, caught up in promises of a better life. Some worship mortal leaders as if they were gods—perhaps even believing them to be the avatar of divinity.

  This sense of belonging, of purpose, can be a powerful lure in this perilous land.

  Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

  This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can [Ask the Oracle](Ironsworn/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle), or follow these guidelines:

    * A common citizen or brute is **troublesome**.
    * A trained warrior is **dangerous**.
    * A powerful or veteran warrior is **formidable**.
