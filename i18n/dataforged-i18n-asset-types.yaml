Starforged/Assets/Companion#Description: |-
  **Companions** are NPC helpers. When you gain a companion, give them a name and envision their look and personality.

  Companions utilize a health meter that can be reduced if an outcome puts them in harm's way. When your companion faces harm, make the [Companion Takes a Hit](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Takes_a_Hit) move. When their health is at 0, they are in danger of being killed or destroyed.

  **Modules** are linked to your STARSHIP and offer additional options and advantages when aboard that vehicle.

  These assets are earned and managed by a single character. They can be shared with allies, but only if it's practical for them to make use of it (not everyone may know how to use a RESEARCH LAB).

  When you [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your STARSHIP. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) it.

  **Paths** are your background, interests, training, skills, powers, and key equipment. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. When you create your character in the next chapter, you'll select at least two paths to get started.

  Some paths represent your skill with a signature weapon style or piece of equipment. If you see a requirement at the top of the asset card, such as “If you wield a bladed weapon…,” the asset is only usable when taking action using that item.
