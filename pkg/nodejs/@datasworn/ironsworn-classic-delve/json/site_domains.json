			"description": "A tanglewood is a thick wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.\n\nMany refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even near settled areas, the tangles still stand.",

			"description": "These subterranean structures are a mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the [Firstborn](id:classic/collections/npcs/firstborn). Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable darkness.\n\nMost [Ironlanders](id:classic/collections/npcs/ironlanders) stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.",
