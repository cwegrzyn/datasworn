They forsake their former lives. Their physical form wastes away. Their mind is shattered.\n\nIn time, only the husk is left. They are a needful thing, tormented by the memory of all they have lost, but willing to lose even more in their quest for power.\n\nA husk may make tempting offers of rituals or rarities, but be wary. Their bargains are always in their own favor. When they turn against you, a husk is a cunning foe. They weave dreadful spells, summon swarms of lesser creatures, and unleash a savagery inflamed by their anguish.",

					"description": "A gloom is a mass of malignant shadow. It dwells in dark places beneath the earth, or in the shadows of thick woods. At twilight and during the long gray days of winter, it emerges from its lightless refuge to sate its hunger.\n\nThe gloom’s amorphous form cannot exert physical force. Instead, it will draw in its victims through illusion, mimicking familiar voices or forms. Or it will use the cover of darkness to ambush unwary prey. Once enveloped, the victim is a captive audience for the gloom’s apparitions, forced to face their innermost doubts and fears. The gloom picks at their sanity like a scavenger cleaning meat from bones. After a time, there is nothing left but an empty shell.\n\nIf trapped within a gloom, let your conviction and courage be your light. Against hopelessness, find hope. Against despair, find peace of mind. Against terror, find faith. In the darkness, it is not the gloom that is your enemy. It is yourself.",

They believe this anomaly offers true enlightenment, and seek a means to unleash it on the Ironlands. Who is the leader of this sect?",

It is drawn to the warmth of living beings, and seeks to douse that life as one would snuff out a candle.\n\nA tempest’s true nature is a mystery. Is it intelligent, or just a force of nature?
