Nearly all the Sundered fell in that long day of fighting, but not before saving many Ironlanders from the varou horde.\n\nKhinara and her handful of remaining comrades left the battleground that day and have not been seen since. A simple cairn marked the sacrifice and courage of the Sundered, from which only this small stone remains.",

The sounds and visions within the fire are then made more vibrant.\n\nCuriously, the Beholder’s Dust is never fully consumed by the flames. Each time you return to the pouch, you will find the supply of ash replenished.",

Beads sometimes appear or disappear from the chain of their accord, but the particular bead you need for a talisman is generally at hand.",

This will guide me back home. Back to you.”\n\nBut his ship did not return. Weeks passed. Then months. All hope seemed lost. One night, as the mourning husband held the string tight in a closed fist, there came a knock at the door. It was the sailor, with no memory of what brought him there.\n\nCenturies later, these twin strings—passed into legend and now returned—are held in a simple wooden box. When you carry it, you are reminded of the importance of a place and the people there, and it helps set you on the path home.",
