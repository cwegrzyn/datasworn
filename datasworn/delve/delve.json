Then, fill in the blanks by using the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description), [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail), [Namesake](id:delve/oracles/site_name/namesake), and [Place](id:delve/oracles/site_name/place) oracles.\n\nIf the form of a particular word doesn’t work, try making it plural instead of singular, or vice-versa.\n\nIf you already know the theme and domain, you can pick from the tables instead of rolling. If not, you can use these oracles to help define those aspects of the site. Use the [Place](id:delve/oracles/site_name/place) oracle to roll for a domain, and let the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) oracles inform your selection of a theme.\n\nThe site’s name might be known in your world, or it could just be an evocative label you use to understand its history and nature.\n\nEven without giving a site a name, you can use the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) oracles to help flesh out the theme and nature of that place.\n\nFor example, you hear rumors about a nearby ruin while visiting a settlement. What do you learn? You [Ask the Oracle](id:classic/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle), using the [Description](id:delve/oracles/site_name/description) and [Detail](id:delve/oracles/site_name/detail) tables. The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”\n\nInterpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest.",

Use the [Character Goal](id:classic/oracles/character/goal) oracle to give the monstrosity a purpose. Roll on the [Character Disposition](id:classic/oracles/character/disposition) and [Activity](id:delve/oracles/character/activity) oracles to frame your initial encounter.

			"description": "These oracles support the optional threat mechanics detailed in Chapter 6.\n\nYou can use the [Category](id:delve/oracles/threat/category) oracle above to randomly select a broad type of threat for your campaign. If you are told to roll twice, take both results and decide how these two threats act together or represent a more complex situation. For example, choosing both a [Malignant Plague](id:delve/oracles/threat/malignant_plague) and [Zealous Cult](id:delve/oracles/threat/zealous_cult) might signify an evil sect which has unleashed a sickness upon the Ironlands in service to some dark god.\n\nFor additional detail, use other oracles as appropriate. For example, you can look to the [Action](id:classic/oracles/action_and_theme/action) and [Theme](id:classic/oracles/action_and_theme/theme) oracles (Ironsworn Core, page 174) or [Character Goal](id:classic/oracles/character/goal) oracle (Ironsworn Core, page 182) to define the motivations of a [Scheming Leader](id:delve/oracles/threat/scheming_leader).\n\nOnce you’ve introduced a threat, consider how it endangers something or someone important to you, and [Swear an Iron Vow](id:classic/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to see its goal undone.\n\nThen, as you [Advance a Threat](id:delve/moves/threat/advance_a_threat), you can roll on the oracle table for your specific threat to generate an action, approach, or complication. Interpret the oracle’s answer as appropriate to the nature of the threat and the current situation.\n\nIf you aren’t using the threat mechanics within your campaign, you can use still these oracles to inspire details for enemies, troubles, and complications.",

Others are bizarre aberrations seemingly born of chaos. A few even possess twisted mockeries of human features.\n\nThey are rare beasts, but dwell in every region and environment of the Ironlands, from the dark waters of the [Ragged Coast](id:classic/atlas/ironlands/ragged_coast) to the icy plains of the [Shattered Wastes](id:classic/atlas/ironlands/shattered_wastes). Often, they protect ancient ruins, forgotten relics, and other secrets. They watch and wait, and show no mercy to those who trespass in their domain.\n\nWe do not know the origin of the nightspawn. They are enigmatic creatures, rarely emerging from their dark lairs except during the long nights of winter. Is it the latent magic of these lands which gives them life? Have they passed through the veil from some other realm? Perhaps some questions are best left unanswered.",

Years later, they delivered a grand, gold-rimmed mirror that—they said—would reveal worlds and beings beyond the veil. The hopeful merchant had the mirror placed in his chambers and sent his staff away. A day later, a servant returned to find the merchant vanished and the mirror shattered.\n\nThis piece of broken glass, the edges smoothed by time, the surface darkened and tarnished, is all that remains of that ancient mirror. Carrying it with you strengthens the thread between you and those that dwell in the realms between life and death.",

One night, as the mourning husband held the string tight in a closed fist, there came a knock at the door. It was the sailor, with no memory of what brought him there.\n\nCenturies later, these twin strings—passed into legend and now returned—are held in a simple wooden box. When you carry it, you are reminded of the importance of a place and the people there, and it helps set you on the path home.",

It is a dangerous path, prone to floods and collapse.\n\nWithin the bog itself, amid the black waters and tangled wilds of the fen, the cult of the One Beneath Us practices their rituals. Utterly devoted to the strange deity of decay, the cultists formerly kept to themselves. But recently, they’ve struck out, traveling by boat through the cavern passage. They gather supplies and new adherents from local settlements—through force if necessary.\n\nA perpetual storm seems to hang over the marsh, its dark clouds roiling. Could the cultists serving the One Beneath Us be reaching a zenith in their work?",

Five years ago, he agreed to lead a group of folk headed for a mining settlement through an icebound pass. He departed too late in the season, and winter fell upon the mountains with brutal force. The expedition never emerged.\n\nWhat horrors befell the group can only be guessed. All that remained of their makeshift camps were long-cold fire pits, crystalline patches of frozen blood, and gnawed bones. It’s said the spirits of those travelers still haunt the pass now known as Egan’s Folly. Travelers report strange and unsettling sounds echoing through the crags. Dark forms and hungry eyes appear half-glimpsed within blinding snowstorms. What happened here? Is there some way to put the tormented souls to rest?",

The monster’s presence taints the waters of the cave, blackening them, tinging them with an acrid odor. Moreover, nearby aquatic life takes on qualities of the nightspawn, reshaped into aberrant forms by its creeping vileness. These monstrosities drift farther and farther from the cave, spreading the corruption to ships and settlements.\n\nRecently, folk have undertaken pilgrimages to this sea cave.

Sailing this passage requires careful navigation around jagged, hull-shattering rocks. For the skilled and the lucky, relative calm awaits in the inner bay anchorage, which is sheltered by a massive overhanging cliff. Ancient tone steps lead from the shore into a grand doorway in the side of the rock face.\n\nBeyond the doorway, vast passages and chambers are carved through the center of Hollowmount Island. This underkeep, undiscovered until recently, preserves the secrets and history of a long-forgotten people.\n\nLast year, a band of raiders took up residence within the outer halls of the underkeep. When not attacking coastal settlements, they live in comfort and without concern for their defenses. Who else, other than their own leader—a skilled sailor they call Kayu the Bold—is foolish enough to make landfall here? But they have neglected to consider the dangers that may lie within. Will the raiders fall prey to the deadly traps and long-dead guardians which protect the secrets of this place?",

It is the Old World reborn, they say, a wellspring of hope in a harsh land.\n\nBut there is a darker truth here. The settlement was built directly on top of an age-old underkeep. Within the longhouse, a sealed and guarded stone pit is a gateway to the labyrinthine underdark. The villagers perform a nightly rite by slaying an animal or beast and casting the corpse into the depths. This keeps the denizens of the underkeep at bay, they say, but many are not so sure. Some complain of lost memories and dark dreams of their time in the village. Others sing laments for loved ones who did not return from a sojourn there. What secrets do the folk of Redhome protect?",

The power of that hate infects this place like a sickness, seeping into the waters and contaminating the woods. It gives a horrid new life to those who die here, and fallen elves soon rise again to fight alongside their kin. They are called the twice-born.\n\nIn some skirmishes, the dead outnumber the living. Soon, perhaps only the twice-born will remain. What can be done to end this forever war?",

There, he discovered the stones scattered in shallow waters and buried in mud near the shore—all that was left of the ancient place which haunted his dreams. Piece by piece, he recovered the remains of the fortress, transplanting the stones laboriously to an island at the lake’s center.\n\nMost laughed at this crazy venture. But some joined Kord, drawn to this place by a compulsion they can’t understand or explain. Guided by the stonewright’s unwavering vision, they rebuilt the vaults of the fortress and its tall central spire. Today, nearly two decades later, the workforce numbers in the hundreds. They live in ramshackle camps encircling the fortress and on the lakeshore. Many protect the place with spear and shield. The stones sing to them, they say, and with each block mortared in place the words become clearer. Folk of this area call them the builders.\n\nThe strange tower, nearly complete, now looms over the valley. There’s a hum in the air, an expectant energy like the lull before a great storm. What is about to happen?",

It’s said the trove of the warlord lies in the heart of Topplekeep, and perhaps could be reached at night, when the bladewings hunt. But this is a fool’s errand. More than just the bladewings lurk in this place. What other dangers lie within?",

Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable darkness.\n\nMost [Ironlanders](id:classic/collections/npcs/ironlanders) stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.",
