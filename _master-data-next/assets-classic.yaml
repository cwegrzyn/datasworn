      Companions are your NPC helpers. When you acquire a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality. If they don’t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.

      Companions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](ironsworn/moves/suffer/companion_endure_harm) move to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.

      *Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform [combat moves](ironsworn/moves/combat). A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.

      Combat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a **Shield-Bearer** and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.

      Magic in *Ironsworn* is cast through rituals which help support your actions or act as unique moves. Like all assets, rituals can be selected as you gain experience and can be upgraded over time to make them more flexible or powerful.

      All rituals utilize a move as their default marked ability. You must make this move and the associated action roll to trigger the effect. Any secondary abilities you gain by upgrading the asset are dependent on performing the ritual described as the default ability.
